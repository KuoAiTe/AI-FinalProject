# COMP6600-FinalProject

##Hi, Teammates
I hope this would help you guys. :)
Feel free if you have any question using Github.
If you have any ideas, please add that into thoughts.md

To use Github
Open the terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to develop your project

If you already have a git repository, then run the following code
>git pull https://github.com/KuoAiTe/COMP7970-004-FinalProject.git

Otherwise, use the following code:
>git clone https://github.com/KuoAiTe/COMP7970-004-FinalProject.git

Because you cannot directly access the master branch, so create your new branch name using the command:

>Creates a new branch but leaves you on the same branch.
>>git branch branchName

>Switches to the new branch
>>git checkout branchName

>or simply use, which creates a new branch and switches to that branch :
>>git checkout -b branchName

>Then you can do whatever you want. When done, do the following commands:
>>git add .

>>git commit -m "message about your addition to the code"

>>git push

Creates pull requests whenever your code is ready to merge.
